## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 1, we decided to focus on developing the Dining Hall Meal Manager web application. We discussed and selected the programming language and libraries for the project. Our work during this sprint included implementing core backend functionalities such as user login, registration, database setup, tracking student meal balances, and managing meal plan preferences. In addition, we worked on the frontend and the UI for the web pages such as login, register, main page, contact us, and today’s menu.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Teamwork
* Delegating issues on Kanban board to each of the team members
* Frequent Team meetings to discuss the tasks and make plans ahead
* Team communication with prompt responses

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Self-studying Python Flask library in more detail as most of us have never used it in project before
* Debugging issues in backend functionalities using Python Flask library
* Working on implementing more backend functionalities to streamline user experience of our web application
* Adding more UI and frontend where necessary

Here are the changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Self-studying Python Flask library in more detail as most of us have never used it in project before
* Implementing more backend features including database management for our project
* Completing the rest of user interfaces for our web application
* Merging features we’ve worked on from separate branches into one main branch
* Adding frontend features to pages lacking a specific UI, to match the overarching theme of the project
