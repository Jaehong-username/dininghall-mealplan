## What's New (User Facing)
* Feature 4: Let Managers Track Meal Usage
* Feature 6: Let Employees Upload Photos of Today's Meals
* Feature 10: User Feedback System for Dining Hall Services
* Feature 11: Finishing Admin Portal to Manage Menus, Meal Plans, and Usage Reports
* Feature 46: Two Factor Authentication
* Feature 48: Update Models with Consistent Primary Keys

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 3, we decided to split up our tasks to make sure that everyone would be able to contribute to the sprint. Since we already finished most of our issues, only a few remained. We mainly focused on finishing partially completed features, such as the admin dashboard, in the backend. Additionally, we worked the front end, polishing up the overall theme of our application. We also added new pages for image uploads, displaying the statistics of meals, and two-factor authentication checks. This backend helped focus on displaying and updating database information. It also helped with creating a more secure application for our users.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* Easy communication with team members
* Collaboration and task division within our team
* Backend functionality progress
* Effective sprint planning

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Improve version control practices to minimize merge conflicts
* Allocate more time for working on issues before the sprint deadline
* Adding more comments to our code to ensure easy readability

Here are the changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Incorporation of 2FA to secure our web app
* Merging features weâ€™ve worked on from separate branches into one main branch
* Completing the rest of the functional requirements such as manager usage reports and changing password
* Implementing more backend features as needed
* Adding frontend features to pages lacking a specific UI, to match the overarching theme of the project
* Discussing and planning how to implement future features together
